From the mxit document:
http://code.mxit.com/Documentation/Mobiportal/RTFM.aspx#services

The format for MXit redirects are:

mxit://[target:option;option]/parameters 

Option	Description
Refresh	Send the request to the target service without adding it to the history stack
Root	Send the request to the target service and make this the new root of the history stack
Data	Send the request to the target service and store the data in the history cache for when the session is restored with the back command
TempContact=	This is added after any of the other options seperated by a comma seperator. This instructs the proxy to create a temporary contact for the redirect. You may define a alias or not which the proxy will use the default alias for that service. This opens the contact in a new tab. e.g. mxit://[myservicename:TempContact=]/

HTML link for Mobi API 

An example of the link to another service is:

<a href="mxit://[ServiceName]/" type="mxit/service-navigation">Go to Service</a> 

Note the type attribute of the tag this marks this link as a service redirect. Replace “ServiceName” with the name of the service you want to redirect to. eg.:
<a href="mxit://[tradepost]/" type="mxit/service-navigation">Go to Tradepost</a>
-->

<tal:mxit-chatroom-link omit-tag="" condition="viewlet/can_show">
<a href="mxit://[ServiceName]/" type="mxit/service-navigation"
    tal:attributes="href string:mxit://${viewlet/chatroom}/">
    <span tal:replace="string:Go to chatroom:${viewlet/chatroom}">Go to chatroom</span>
</a> 
</tal:mxit-chatroom-link>
